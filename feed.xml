    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I have started contributing to Ruby Bench project.
I wrote a few words about it in my &lt;a target="_blank" href="/2017/05/28/getting-into-open-source/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to summarize contributions I've made during last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sequel benchmarks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we have Sequel benchmarks set up and running. Some results are already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://rubybench.org/jeremyevans/sequel/commits?result_type=sequel/mysql2_scope_all&amp;amp;display_count=2000"&gt;onsite&lt;/a&gt;. Last year GSoC student got most of work done here, I was happy to finish it up and make it onsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Comparing results between libraries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far you could have tracked performance of various libraries and platforms present on Ruby Bench.
Though you couldn't tell which one performs better or even how changing library dependencies affect its performance.
Being able to compare performance between ORM libraries can be useful when deciding which one to use in your stack.
How much performance is left on table when using one? You may want to take that insight into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are some comparison highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://rubybench.org/rails/rails/commits?result_type=activerecord/mysql2_scope_all&amp;amp;display_count=200&amp;amp;compare_with=activerecord/postgres_scope_all"&gt;ActiveRecord and Sequel performs better with postgres.&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://rubybench.org/rails/rails/commits?result_type=activerecord/mysql2_scope_all&amp;amp;display_count=20&amp;amp;compare_with=sequel/mysql2_scope_all"&gt;Sequel performs generally faster than ActiveRecord.&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further we need some comparison insight how much performance is being left on table. Therefore we need to have these benchmarks running against raw &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2"&gt;mysql&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg"&gt;pg&lt;/a&gt; gems. Maybe ruby implementation comparisons would be interesting to see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Other contributions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During last month I've made number of other smaller contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby-bench/ruby-bench-web/issues/193" target="_blank"&gt;Fixed&lt;/a&gt; Rails benchmarks which were broken for some time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We can now run benchmark suite &lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby-bench/ruby-bench-web/pull/210" target="_blank"&gt;manually&lt;/a&gt; for number of last commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Next steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sam Saffron &lt;a href="https://community.rubybench.org/t/how-can-active-record-be-faster/142/11" target="_blank"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;, we need to make our benchmarks more honest and put them in order. Next step is to add &lt;i&gt;real world&lt;/i&gt; bench. Here's &lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby-bench/ruby-bench-suite/pull/88" target="_blank"&gt;WIP&lt;/a&gt; regarding this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Getting Into Open Source &amp;nbsp;&amp;#9875;</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so here I am. Starting the Open Source journey.
It feels great to be part of the global team. It's a great opportunity
for everyone to share knowledge and thoughts through code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So everyone has his own &lt;i&gt;How did I get into open source&lt;/i&gt; thing. I was lucky to
be accepted into the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5251786557358080"&gt;Google Summer of Code 2017&lt;/a&gt;. It is a great opportunity for students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next three months I will be working on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://rubybench.org/"&gt;Ruby Bench&lt;/a&gt; project. It's purpose is to continously track
performance of ruby ecosystem - frameworks (Ruby on Rails), apps (Discourse), various gems (ActiveRecord, Sequel), Bundler, and ruby language itself. Take a look at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruby-bench/ruby-bench-suite/blob/master/README.md"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of what is currently being benchmarked on Ruby Bench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby Bench is essential in ruby community because it provides feedback on performance.
Developers should have continous information how good they are doing something.
Performance is one of many aspects we should take care of in developing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was assigned three mentors from Rails team though other folks are getting involved into discussions also.
GSoC starts every year with Community bonding period, during which students are getting familiar with codebases
and community. This is probably the period when you ought be the most annoying dude in community with all these questions popping out.
Except being annoying, I am focusing on tiny contributions at the moment. Even &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruby-bench/ruby-bench/pull/23"&gt;improving readme file&lt;/a&gt; is a good start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am super excited about following summer and will do my best to keep blogging on weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for my first blog post,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers â˜•&lt;/p&gt;
