This was my first conference talk in which I introduced the audience with the
Ruby Bench project. It was part of the Balkan Ruby 2018 conference hosted in
Sofia, capital of Bulgaria. Overall it was a great experience meeting a lot of
interesting people working on various projects.

I am really happy with the outcome of my talk since many people got interested
in the project I presented. Some folks got inspired to build similar
platforms for their language communities while others were interested in having
their gems run on the Ruby Bench platform. The guy from GitHub, Robert Mosolgo <a target="_blank" href="https://rmosolgo.github.io/blog/2018/06/14/trip-report-balkan-ruby-2018/">highlighted this talk</a>
to be one of the most interesting among many others. With that said, I would
mark this talk as successful.

In the video attached below you can listen to my first conference talk about
Ruby Bench project. Enjoy! üçø
